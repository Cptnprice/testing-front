                        Housesale chose to work together with the Lebanese designer Nada Debs. We are thrilled to present this collaboration and the LJUV collection, and we hope that you can see, feel, use the connection between a designer from the Middle East  democratic design.
                        Nada Debs is a Levantine designer living and working in Beirut. Her work spans scale and discipline: from product to furniture design to one-off commission across craft, art, fashion, and interiors. Nada grew up in Japan, studied design in Rhode Island School of Design in the US, and has spent significant periods living and traveling the world, finding connections of each of her experiences in all her work. She calls her approach handmade, and heart-made!

                        Shopping at IKEA is a bit different and exciting compared to your shopping at an everyday retail.

                        When you visit IKEA store, make yourself at home in our many room settings in the store. Squeeze the upholsteries, feel the oriental rugs, try the sofa beds and open the cabinets to feel the quality. On the price tag, you’ll find all you need to know about a product, including where in the store you can pick it up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since most IKEA furniture is flat-packed, they are quite easy to bring home when you buy from the store.
